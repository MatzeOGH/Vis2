Our implementation uses \href{https://github.com/cg-tuwien/Gears-Vk}{\texttt{ Gears-\/\+Vk}} which can be seen as a productivity layer between the verbose Vulkan-\/\+API and the programmer. It offers full Vulkan functionality but with a lot of convenience functions to make our programming life easier. It furthermore also offers out of the box, which is relevant for our project\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Window Management (GLFW)
\item Render-\/\+Loop and Input Handling
\item A ready to use controllable camera class and comes already integrated with \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui}{\texttt{ Dear Im\+Gui}} which is a convenient user interface library.

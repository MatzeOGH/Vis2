 The Advanced Line Renderer is a Windows-\/\+Application based on the paper \href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216549}{\texttt{ "{}Advanced Rendering of Line Data with Ambient Occlusion and Transparency"{}}} by David Groß and Stefan Gumhold.

The Project was implemented by Mathias Hürbe and Gerald Kimmersdorfer for the Visualization 2 course of the Technical University Vienna in the summer semester 2022.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Download}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
An already compiled version for {\itshape Windows 10 x64} of the Line Renderer can be downloaded \href{down/line_renderer_x64.zip}{\texttt{ here}}.

If you have a different operating system you have to compile the application by yourself. Please feel free to download the source code from our \href{https://github.com/MatzeOGH/Vis2.git}{\texttt{ repository on github}}. You may wanna follow the instructions in the \mbox{\hyperlink{index_setup-dev-environment}{following chapter}}.\hypertarget{index_setup-dev-environment}{}\doxysubsection{Setup Dev-\/\+Environment}\label{index_setup-dev-environment}
As our application utilizes \href{https://github.com/cg-tuwien/Gears-Vk}{\texttt{ Gears-\/\+Vk}}, therefore all of the requirements for this framework have to be fullfilled\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/}{\texttt{ Visual Studio 2019}} with \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50590700/how-do-i-install-windows-10-sdk-for-use-with-visual-studio-2017}{\texttt{ Windows 10 SDK (10.\+0.\+18362.\+0)}}
\item \href{https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home}{\texttt{ Vulkan SDK}} (1.\+2.\+189.\+2)
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you have all of the requirements installed you can continue to check out our source code with\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/MatzeOGH/Vis2.git -\/-\/recurse-\/submodules }

\end{DoxyCode}


As we use some functionality of a different branch of Gears-\/\+VK which is not yet integrated in the main branch you have to manually switch to this branch with the following commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd Vis2/Gears-\/Vk}
\DoxyCodeLine{git fetch -\/-\/all}
\DoxyCodeLine{git checkout remotes/origin/artr2022\_assignment3}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{git submodule update -\/-\/remote -\/-\/merge}

\end{DoxyCode}


If everything worked fine you are now ready to open the project\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{start Vis2.sln}

\end{DoxyCode}


Now make the {\bfseries{Vis2}}-\/Project the startup project and you should be good to go. \begin{quote}
{\bfseries{INFO}}\+: The first (ever) build-\/process usually gets stuck during the resolve of some Nu\+Get-\/package. If this happens to you just cancel the build and restart the process. \end{quote}
